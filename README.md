To run locally:  

    ```cd vis``` - to navigate to vis directory    
    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```  
    ```python app.py```

I recommend to run the server locally, as the heroku web server simply refuses to run an innocuous d3 operation to change a single text box which displays if an error has occured to the user.
